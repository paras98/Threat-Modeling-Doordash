## Detailed Framework Analysis Report

### PCI-DSS
DoorDash, as a payment processor and a merchant, is required to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. PCI-DSS, Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, defines a set of security standards to protect cardholders‚Äô data and prevent fraud. Every merchant dealing with payment must comply with the 12 requirements defined under PCI-DSS. Failure to comply with the same can result in penalties, fines & legal actions. Ever since DoorDash suffered data breaches, especially some data loss-related credit cards, there has been a major opportunity to reevaluate the overall security posture in the payment department. Thus, we must analyze the PCI-DSS framework on the current structure to the compliance of the same

**Metric of Success**
A high percentage of successful audits would suggest that DoorDash is successfully putting in place and maintaining the appropriate security controls, as well as that it is taking the necessary precautions to safeguard its payment systems and customer data against data breaches and cyberattacks. A successful audit could serve to increase client confidence and give businesses a competitive edge [4].

### STRIDE 
This framework was developed by two engineers from Microsoft in the 1990‚Äôs. The six components of STRIDE framework are spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, and elevation of privilege. [5]
Payment systems such as one DoorDash are vulnerable to multiple attacks which are well documented based on past incidents on payment systems. Attackers are always finding ways to attack these systems since the benefits of such an attack are huge for an attacker. An attacker who successfully manages to exploit a component within the network that handles these transactions, the transfer of data from the Point of Sale to the bank databases, or any component that is involved in the payment would have a huge benefit-to-risk ratio.


<img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/xQSyNGdpOmxNjPtzNbsDWw7USpmEbvI787xoD09JVz0mE_5gmjiNKcATqN1FVA4aZLpw9C8ic_3R4TZP9QRNFLPwuV1LmZBJXxNA-YOKvYsm3ch9EKsMjQUY5ty8PFAx0slihFfZrQK_pLZyJSbQv2g" width="300" height="300" />



**Advantages:**
- With the STRIDE framework, the focus is more on the risks associated with any system. Payment systems require careful analysis of all kinds of potential risks associated with them through various components in the entire payment flow starting from the customer‚Äôs device to the server and the payment gateways. [13]
- Another major advantage is that Doordash could use STRIDE and other threat modeling frameworks to analyze potential threats since STRIDE is compatible with other frameworks. 
**Disadvantages:**
- It could take a lot of time and resources to identify all of the threats in Doordash‚Äôs payment system since it is complex and involves third-party payment gateways as well. When a new feature has to be introduced, analyzing threats using STRIDE could take away a lot of useful time that could be used in the development of the new feature which would help the company. [14]
- It requires expertise to efficiently utilize the STRIDE framework to analyze threats because analysis at a high level may be easy but to back any proposals for change with evidence is a challenge that is faced by inexperienced individuals in the field.

**Metric of Success**
If the threats from external devices and internal systems are minimal in the report after STRIDE analysis, it would mean that DoorDash has implemented required security controls to secure data. If STRIDE analysis is done regularly and with careful analysis and discussions, it would be possible to eliminate chances of new attacks or zero days as well since it checks the systems in depth and covers non-overlapping areas.

### PASTA
It is a risk-centric threat modeling, PASTA framework provides a comprehensive, risk-centric approach to identifying and managing risks associated with the payment system, it can help DoorDash ensure the security and efficiency of the payment system, which is crucial to its success.
DoorDash is very careful about protecting its payment system. If any security lapse occurs, it could lead to a lot of money being lost and DoorDash's reputation being damaged. So, DoorDash has put together a very strict security system to deal with any potential problems.

**Why NIST CSF is good for Doordash?**
1. Data corruption on Payment Database: By identifying important data assets and setting up suitable protections to prevent corruption, the NIST CSF can assist Doordash in reducing the risk of data corruption. The framework can be used to set up procedures for keeping an eye out for spotting instances of data corruption. 
2. Social engineering: The NIST CSF can help organizations address the risk of social engineering attacks by implementing controls such as security awareness training for employees, multi-factor authentication, and access controls. The framework can also be used to establish incident response plans for social engineering scenarios.
3. Zero-day attacks on payment processing mechanisms: The NIST CSF can help Doordash to reduce the risk of zero-day attacks on its payment mechanisms by implementing a risk-based vulnerability management program, which emphasizes the inclusion of regular vulnerability scanning and patching. It also highlights the importance of continuous monitoring for the detection of potential zero-day exploits.
4. Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on payment gateways: The NIST CSF can help Doordash address prevalent the risk of DoS attacks by enforcing the implementation of controls such as network segmentation, intrusion prevention systems, and incident response plans for DoS incidents. DoorDash is a very dynamic platform and undergoing a Dos attack to its payment gateways might become fatal to business and can challenge its sustenance. 
5. Data breach from users payment-information database: As a client-centric company, reputation drives the business of Doordash. NIST CSF also points out the need for response to data breaches by identifying critical data assets (especially payment information), implementing appropriate safeguards to protect against unauthorized access, confidentiality of payment mechanisms and establishing incident response plans for data breaches, etc. 
**Advantage of using NIST CSF**
- NIST CSF emphasizes continuous improvement, which the organization can benefit a lot from. Doordash will be constantly on the loop for improved security enhancements towards emerging threats in a changing business environment especially on its payment systems.
- The flexibility of NIST CSF makes it easier for adoption.
