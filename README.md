## üöÄ Overview

This README summarizes the comprehensive analysis of DoorDash's payment system, highlighting key frameworks, security considerations, and recommendations for maintaining a secure and efficient payment infrastructure. Our goal is to ensure DoorDash's system is robust against security threats while offering a seamless user experience.

## üóùÔ∏è Key Findings

### Payment System Overview

- DoorDash employs payment gateways like Stripe and Visa Direct for customer transactions.
- Security is paramount, with encryption and compliance frameworks such as PCI-DSS in place to protect customer information.
[Details]
- Doordash payment system involves multiple steps and various components starting from the customer till the payment is completed
    
- Doordash utilizes payment gateways such as Stripe and Visa Direct for handling payments from customers
    
- Point of Sale (PoS) are used in abundance and forms an important part of the payment system
    
- DoorDash's payment system is designed to be simple and practical for consumers and businesses, while also providing fair compensation for Dashers

### Security Challenges

- Historical breaches in 2019 and 2022 highlight vulnerabilities in third-party components, underscoring the need for continuous security enhancement.
[Details]
- All of the payment gateways and the Doordash software has to be secure against attacks by regularly staying compliant with set frameworks and testing procedures
- PII of customers has to be secured at every phase of payment and should use proper encryption mechanisms
- Security breach could result in putting a hold to Doordash‚Äôs operations
- The hack of 2019 and 2022 showed how a potential third part vulnerability can result in compromising CVVs, credit card number, names & other sensitive info about the customers
- The security aspect of the system must be constantly updated on all possible attack vectors.
### Framework Analysis

- **PCI-DSS**: Essential for payment data compliance, offering a structured approach to security but requiring significant effort and resources.
- **STRIDE**: Provides a comprehensive model for identifying threats, although it can be resource-intensive.
- **PASTA**: A risk-centric framework that emphasizes the identification and mitigation of security risks.
- **OCTAVE FORTE**: Focuses on risk management, offering a detailed understanding of potential system risks.
- **NIST CSF**: Advocates for a balanced cybersecurity posture across five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.
- **No Framework**: Suggests a more customized approach to security, focusing on specific DoorDash needs but lacking the structured guidance of established frameworks.

## Detailed Framework Analysis Report

### PCI-DSS
DoorDash, as a payment processor and a merchant, is required to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. PCI-DSS, Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, defines a set of security standards to protect cardholders‚Äô data and prevent fraud. Every merchant dealing with payment must comply with the 12 requirements defined under PCI-DSS. Failure to comply with the same can result in penalties, fines & legal actions. Ever since DoorDash suffered data breaches, especially some data loss-related credit cards, there has been a major opportunity to reevaluate the overall security posture in the payment department. Thus, we must analyze the PCI-DSS framework on the current structure to the compliance of the same
